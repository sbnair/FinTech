This is a machine learning project created for FinTechs. It is designed to be used when they are planning on expanding internationally.

## How is this useful?

FinTechs like payments and lending solely see entrepreneurs as their target audience. Their market is people who accept payments in any form and want to manage these payments so what if there is a way to measure entrepreneurship in a country and the features that reflect that.

## Machine learining for real problems

I have yet to see a machine learning project used for day to day business problems. It's either let's figure out how to cure cancer or let's use a boring as hell government datasets to project future crime rates.

This project is different and it uses a couple of supervised learning algorithms and a set of sexy features that really can be used to reflect the level of entrepreneurship in a country
